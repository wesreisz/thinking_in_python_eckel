# ThinkingInPythonEckel
This project is part of my desire to add a dynamic language to by skillset. As part of "keeping my knife sharp," I've ran through an introduction to python course on Microsoft Virtual Academy, and am now moving on to Thinking in Python by Bruce Eckel. 

The two learning materials could not be further apart. The Microsoft Virtual Academy is targeted for folks who are learning their first language. I took this to see what the training material was like for potential use in my classes at UofL. So for a new developer, the course is great. Thinking in Python (at least so far and my knowing Bruce's reputation) will be on the opposite end of the spectrum. 

This repo is for sample work and exercises Bruce recommends in Thinking in Python.
